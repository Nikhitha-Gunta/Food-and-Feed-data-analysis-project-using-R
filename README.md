**Global Agricultural Trends Analysis: Food vs. Feed Production Insights using R**
This repository contains the R code and analysis for the project "Global Agricultural Trends Analysis: Food vs. Feed Production Insights using R", which explores the dynamic trends in global food and feed production from 1961 to 2013. The project aims to provide strategic insights into agricultural production priorities and potential areas for sustainable development in anticipation of the global population growth projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050.

**Project Overview**
This project conducts a comprehensive data analysis on a global food production dataset obtained from Kaggle. It utilizes the R programming language and various packages from the Tidyverse suite to assess trends in food and feed production. The analysis covers data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and visualization to identify key trends and insights into global agricultural production.

**Key Objectives**
Assess trends in global food and feed production from 1961 to 2013.
Analyze the impact of global population growth on agricultural demands.
Identify the top 5 global producers of food and feed.
Provide strategic insights for sustainable agricultural development.
Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle: World Food/Feed Production. It contains detailed records of food and feed production across various countries from 1961 to 2013.

**Tools and Technologies**
R: Used for all data analysis and visualization tasks.
Tidyverse: A collection of R packages used for data manipulation, cleaning, and plotting.
ggplot2: Utilized for creating insightful visualizations of the data trends.

**Key Findings**
The analysis highlights significant increases in global food production compared to feed production from 1961 to 2013.
The top 5 global producers of food and feed have been identified, providing insight into the countries leading agricultural production.
Trends and insights derived from the analysis suggest potential strategies for addressing the challenges of sustainable agricultural development in the face of global population growth.
